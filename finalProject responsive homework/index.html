  <main>
    <p>Mining is a complex interaction between people, machines, and the earth itself. From surface operations to underground workings, every environment presents unique challenges that demand precision, safety, and efficiency.</p>

    <p>This gallery highlights key aspects of modern mining operations, including excavation, hauling, processing, and site infrastructure. Each image captures the scale of operations and the role of both human expertise and heavy machinery.</p>

    <p>The layout of this site adapts to different screen sizes and user preferences, ensuring accessibility and usability across devices. Visual elements respond to system color settings and motion preferences to create a comfortable viewing experience.</p>
